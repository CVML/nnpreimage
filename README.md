Code for Visualizing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using Natural Pre-images, IJCV 2016

This code is not very easy to use at the moment. All the visualizations were generated by running experiments/exp_all.m . Several parts of this are commented out for now. Please open this file and uncomment the visualization you are interested in. If you are using the maximization part of the code then you need to precompute network statistics using the helpers/get_network_stats.m script which uses imagenet to compute neuron max, min, mean values.
